dotenv 
- a library which enables file-based storing of environment variables
- installation: npm install dotenv
- create a hidden (.env) file in the server directory
- do not commit to github repo (add .env to .gitignore)
- syntax:
    FIRST_SECRET_KEY="first key value"
    SECOND_SECRET_KEY="second key value"
- include the following in server.js:
    require('dotenv').config();
- requires the dotenv library and invokes its config function
- retrieve the values from the process.env object with the following:
    const myFirstSecret = process.env.FIRST_SECRET_KEY;

JSON web tokens (JWT)
- a structured method for keeping data secure and preventing data from being tampered with during the response/request cycle
- 3 Main parts:
- Header: holds data about the JWT itself
    {
        "alg": "HS256",     //signing algorithm used (HMAC SHA256 or RSA)
        "typ": "JWT"        //type of token used (JWT)
    }
- Payload: stores the desired claims/information
    - when a new JWT is created, it will create an object that represents the payload.
    - This payload will typically be the id of the user instance that was logged in
    - claims: statements about an entity (the user) and additional data
    - claim names are only 3 characters long as JWT is meant to be compact
    - for signed tokens, though protected against tampering, the payload is readable by anyone. 
    - secret information should not be put in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted.
        - registered: set of recommended but not mandatory, pre-defined claims
            - provides a set of useful, interoperable claims
            - i.e.  iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience)
            - documentation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1
        - public:
            - defined at will by the JWT user
            - to avoid collisions must be defined:
                - in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml)
                - as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace
            - documentation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.2
        - private: custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.
- Signature: signs the JWT
    - creation of the signature requires the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified by the header.
    - verifies that the content has not been tampered with
    - for private keys, verifies that the sender is authentic
- ouput: 3 Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments
    - syntax: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
- installation: npm install jsonwebtoken
- include the following in server.js:
    const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
- authorization: the most common scenario for JWT
    - after login, the JWT is included in every request to grant access to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. 
- information exchange: securely transmitting information between parties
    - signed JWT, using public/private key pairs, ensure that senders are who they say they are
    - the signature is calculated using both the header and payload, enabling verification that the content has not been tampered with.
- use jwt.io Debugger (https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to decode, verify, and generate JWTs.
